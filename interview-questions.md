## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

3. Objects: in javascript objects are a data type that has keys and values to form methods .

4. Method: a keyword in javascript that references the object and is used to create a variable accessing the value

5. Classes: classes are blueprints for objects and they can be customizable  and reusable similar to functions
